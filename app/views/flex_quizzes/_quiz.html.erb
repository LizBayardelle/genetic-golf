       <h3>Q3: How to Perform the Pelvic Tilt Test</h3>
       <p>
         <ol>
           <li>Stand upright in your normal posture.  If you have rounded shoulders that's okay. </li>
           <li>Then tilt forward into your normal 7 iron golf set-up.</li>
           <li>Begin with your arms hanging down, then place your hands on your hips to feel hip movement. </li>
           <li>Next, evaluate your starting posture. Notice if the lower back has an accentuated arch (S-posture), if it is neutral (N-posture), or if the middle of your back is rounded into a slouched position (C-posture). Ideally, you want to start from a neutral position (N-posture ). </li>
           <li>Once starting position has been established, tilt your pelvis out and up several inches away from golf ball then return lower back and pelvis to neutral position. </li>
           <li>Once this move is accomplished tilt the pelvis to the golf ball, flattening your hips by several inches, then return your hips and pelvis to a neutral position. </li>
         </ol>
         Proper execution of this test will yield a forward and backward tilting of the pelvis with no pain or discomfort, minimal knee/foot movement, and limited upper body forward and backward movement.</p>

       <h3>Q5: How to Perform the Pelvic Rotation Test, Back Hip</h3>
       <p><strong>Body Part Being Tested:</strong> Test is for the back/trial hip and backswing turn.  This will be your right hip if you are a right handed golfer and your left hip if you are a left handed golfer.
         <ol>
           <li>Begin in a normal 7 iron posture, then move your hands to the opposite shoulders, with your arms crossed over each other.</li>
           <li>Your feet should be approximately shoulder width apart with your hands resting on the front of each shoulder in a W position.</li>
           <li>Once in position try to rotate your back/trail hip in a backswing motion. This should be done without moving your shoulders and while keeping your weight on the top or inside of your back foot.</li>
           <li>A proper pelvic rotation will yield some motion above the waist line, but the rotation is coming from the pelvis rotating. It is acceptable for the legs and knees to be moving with the hips/pelvis. However, the knees are not moving the pelvis, they are also responding to the movement of the hips/pelvis.</li>
